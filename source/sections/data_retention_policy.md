# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, HealthTensor understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, HealthTensor is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, HealthTensor has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for HealthTensor Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current HealthTensor Customers or Partners might have data stored by HealthTensor as part of HealthTensor's Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are 
	1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from HealthTensor and/or to have HealthTensor continue to store the data at a rate of $0.20/gb per month.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from HealthTensor within 30 days, HealthTensor removed data from HealthTensor systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
