# Vulnerability Scanning Policy

HealthTensor is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. HealthTensor utilizes [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/) on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.

## Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

* 10.m - Control of Technical Vulnerabilities

## Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.308(a)(8) - Evaluation

## Vulnerability Scanning Policy

* Reviewing vulnerability scan reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the HealthTensor Security Officer.
* In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
	* All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
	* Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer, VP of Engineering, and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by HealthTensor.
		* Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
		* Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the HealthTensor Risk Assessment Policy.
* All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by HealthTensor.
